# ðŸŒŠ Adory Vo ðŸŒŠ
ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Adory, a third-year at UC San Diego studying Math & Computer Science to pursue a career in software development and potentially teaching. Computational thinking and well-designed software are the basis for my passion in computer science. Outside of coding, I enjoy listening to new music and curating playlists ([more about that here](https://www.adoryvo.com/music/)) as well as playing video games with friends.
